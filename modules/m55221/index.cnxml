        <caption>Many fluids are flowing in this scene. Water from the hose and smoke from the fire are visible flows. Less visible are the flow of air and the flow of fluids on the ground and within the people fighting the fire. (credit: Andrew Magill, Flickr)</caption></figure>
	<para id="fs-id1522948">How do planes fly? How do we model blood flow? How do sprayers work for paints or aerosols? What is the purpose of a water tower? To answer these questions, we will examine fluid dynamics. The equations governing fluid dynamics are derived from the same equations that represent energy conservation. One of the most powerful equations in fluid dynamics is Bernoulli's equation, which governs the relationship between fluid pressure, kinetic energy, and potential energy (Essential Knowledge 5.B.10). We will see how Bernoulli's equation explains the pressure difference that provides lift for airplanes and provides the means for fluids (like water or paint or perfume) to move in useful ways.</para><para id="eip-617">The content in this chapter supports:</para><para id="fs-id2150694"><emphasis effect="bold">Big Idea 5</emphasis> Changes that occur as a result of interactions are constrained by conservation laws.</para>
