<section id="eip-930"><title>About <emphasis effect="italics">College Physics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses 2e</emphasis></title>
	<para id="eip-941"><emphasis effect="italics">College Physics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses 2e</emphasis> is designed to engage students in their exploration of physics and help them apply these concepts to the Advanced Placement<sup>®</sup> test. Because physics is integral to modern technology and other sciences, the book also includes content that goes beyond the scope of the AP<sup>®</sup> course to further student understanding. The AP<sup>®</sup> Connection in each chapter directs students to the material they should focus on for the AP<sup>®</sup> exam, and what content — although interesting — is not necessarily part of the AP<sup>®</sup> curriculum. This book is Learning List-approved for AP<sup>®</sup> Physics courses.</para>
<para id="eip-111">This content features enhancements from <emphasis effect="italics">TEA AP<sup>®</sup> Physics 1 &amp; 2: Algebra-Based</emphasis> by TEA (Texas Education Agency).

<section id="eip-593"><title>Coverage, scope, and alignment to the AP<sup>®</sup> curriculum</title><para id="eip-232">The current AP<sup>®</sup> Physics curriculum framework outlines the two full-year physics courses AP® Physics 1: Algebra-Based and AP<sup>®</sup> Physics 2: Algebra-Based. These two courses replaced the one-year AP<sup>®</sup> Physics B course, which over the years had become a fast-paced survey of physics facts and formulas that did not provide in-depth conceptual understanding of major physics ideas and the connections between them. 
</para><para id="eip-id1166618342446">AP<sup>®</sup> Physics 1 and 2 courses focus on the big ideas typically included in the first and second semesters of an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course, providing students with the essential knowledge and skills required to support future advanced course work in physics. The AP® Physics 1 curriculum includes mechanics, mechanical waves, sound, and electrostatics. The AP<sup>®</sup> Physics 2 curriculum focuses on thermodynamics, fluid statics, dynamics, electromagnetism, geometric and physical optics, quantum physics, atomic physics, and nuclear physics. Seven unifying themes of physics called the Big Ideas each include three to seven enduring understandings (EU), which are themselves composed of essential knowledge (EK) that provides details and context for students as they explore physics.
</para><para id="eip-id1166616525875">AP<sup>®</sup>  science practices emphasize inquiry-based learning and development of critical thinking and reasoning skills. Inquiry usually uses a series of steps to gain new knowledge, beginning with an observation and following with a hypothesis to explain the observation; then experiments are conducted to test the hypothesis, gather results, and draw conclusions from data. The AP<sup>®</sup> framework has identified seven major science practices, which can be described by short phrases: using representations and models to communicate information and solve problems; using mathematics appropriately; engaging in questioning; planning and implementing data collection strategies; analyzing and evaluating data; justifying scientific explanations; and connecting concepts. The framework’s Learning Objectives merge content (EU and EK) with one or more of the seven science practices that students should develop as they prepare for the AP<sup>®</sup> Physics exam.

us. Why study physics? If you plan to become a physicist, the answer is obvious—introductory physics provides the foundation
for your career; or if you want to become an engineer, physics provides the basis for the engineering principles used to solve
applied and practical problems. For example, after the discovery of the photoelectric effect by physicists, engineers developed
photocells that are used in solar panels to convert sunlight to electricity. What if you are an aspiring medical doctor? Although the
applications of the laws of physics may not be obvious, their understanding is tremendously valuable. Physics is involved in
medical diagnostics, such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical
therapy sometimes directly involves physics; cancer radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation. What if you are planning a nonscience
career? Learning physics provides you with a well-rounded education and the ability to make important decisions, such as
evaluating the pros and cons of energy production sources or voting on decisions about nuclear waste disposal.</para><para id="eip-id1760087">This AP<sup>®</sup>  Physics 1 course begins with <emphasis>kinematics,</emphasis> the study of motion without considering its causes. Motion is everywhere: from the vibration of atoms to the planetary revolutions around the Sun. Understanding motion is key to understanding other concepts in physics. You will then study <emphasis>dynamics,</emphasis> which considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton’s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws provide an example of the breadth and simplicity of the principles under which nature functions. One of the most remarkable simplifications in physics is that only four distinct forces account for all known phenomena. Your journey will continue as you learn about energy. Energy plays an essential role both in everyday events and in scientific phenomena. You can likely name many forms of energy, from that provided by our foods, to the energy we use to run our cars, to the sunlight that warms us on the beach. The next stop is learning about oscillatory motion and waves. All oscillations involve force and energy: you push a child in a swing to get the motion started and you put energy into a guitar string when you pluck it. Some oscillations create waves. For example, a guitar creates sound waves. You will conclude this first physics course with the study of static electricity and electric currents. Many of the characteristics of static electricity can be explored by rubbing things together. Rubbing creates the spark you get from walking across a wool carpet, for example. Similarly, lightning results from air movements under certain weather conditions. </para><para id="eip-id2709738">In the AP<sup>®</sup> Physics 2 course, you will continue your journey by studying <emphasis>fluid dynamics,</emphasis> which explains why rising smoke curls and twists and how the body regulates blood flow. The next stop is <emphasis>thermodynamics,</emphasis> the study of heat transfer—energy in transit—that can be used to do work. Basic physical laws govern how heat transfers and its efficiency. Then you will learn more about electric phenomena as you delve into <emphasis>electromagnetism.</emphasis> An electric current produces a magnetic field; similarly, a magnetic field produces a current. This phenomenon, known as <emphasis>magnetic induction,</emphasis> is essential to our technological society. The generators in cars and nuclear plants use magnetism to generate a current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances. From electromagnetism you will continue your journey to <emphasis>optics,</emphasis> the study of light. You already know that visible light is the type of electromagnetic waves to which our eyes respond. Through vision, light can evoke deep emotions, such as when we view a magnificent sunset or glimpse a rainbow breaking through the clouds. Optics is concerned with the generation and propagation of light. The <emphasis>quantum mechanics, atomic physics,</emphasis> and <emphasis>nuclear physics</emphasis> are at the end of your journey. These areas of physics have been developed at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries and deal with submicroscopic objects. Because these objects are smaller than we can observe directly with our senses and generally must be observed with the aid of instruments, parts of these physics areas may seem foreign and bizarre to you at first. However, we have experimentally confirmed most of the ideas in these areas of physics.</para><para id="eip-id2679551">AP<sup>®</sup>  Physics is a challenging course. After all, you are taking physics at the introductory college level. You will discover that some concepts are more difficult to understand than others; most students, for example, struggle to understand rotational motion and angular momentum or particle-wave duality. The AP<sup>®</sup>  curriculum promotes depth of understanding over breadth of content, and to make your exploration of topics more manageable, concepts are organized around seven major themes called the <emphasis>Big Ideas</emphasis> that apply to all levels of physical systems and interactions between them (see web diagram below). Each Big Idea identifies <emphasis>enduring understandings</emphasis> (EU), <emphasis>essential knowledge </emphasis>(EK), and <emphasis>illustrative examples</emphasis> that support key concepts and content. Simple descriptions define the focus of each Big Idea.</para><list id="eip-id2651669" list-type="bulleted" bullet-style="none"><item>Big Idea 1: Objects and systems have properties.</item>
<item>Big Idea 2: Fields explain interactions. </item>
<item>Big Idea 3: The interactions are described by forces. </item>
<item>Big Idea 4: Interactions result in changes. </item>
<item>Big Idea 5: Changes are constrained by conservation laws. </item>
<item>Big Idea 6: Waves can transfer energy and momentum. </item>
<item>Big Idea 7: The mathematics of probability can to describe the behavior of complex and quantum mechanical systems. </item>
</list><para id="eip-772">Doing college work is not easy, but completion of AP<sup>®</sup>  classes is a reliable predictor of college success and prepares you for subsequent courses. The more you engage in the subject, the easier your journey through the curriculum will be. Bring your enthusiasm to class every day along with your notebook, pencil, and calculator. Prepare for class the day before, and review concepts daily. Form a peer study group and ask your teacher for extra help if necessary. The AP<sup>®</sup>  lab program focuses on more open-ended, student-directed, and inquiry-based lab investigations designed to make you think, ask questions, and analyze data like scientists. You will develop critical thinking and reasoning skills and apply different means of communicating information. By the time you sit for the AP<sup>®</sup> exam in May, you will be fluent in the language of physics; because you have been doing real science, you will be ready to show what you have learned. Along the way, you will find the study of the world around us to be one of the most relevant and enjoyable experiences of your high school career. </para><para id="eip-15">Irina Lyublinskaya, PhD<newline/>
