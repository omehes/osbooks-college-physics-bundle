        <para id="import-auto-id1169737716004"><term id="import-auto-id1169737910252">Superconductors</term> are materials with a resistivity of zero. They are familiar to the general public because of their practical applications and have been mentioned at a number of points in the text. Because the resistance of a piece of superconductor is zero, there are no heat losses for currents through them; they are used in magnets needing high currents, such as in MRI machines, and could cut energy losses in power transmission. But most superconductors must be cooled to temperatures only a few kelvin above absolute zero, a costly procedure limiting their practical applications. In the past decade, tremendous advances have been made in producing materials that become superconductors at relatively high temperatures. There is hope that room temperature superconductors may someday be manufactured.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1169738110664">Superconductivity was discovered accidentally in 1911 by the Dutch physicist H. Kamerlingh Onnes (1853–1926) when he used liquid helium to cool mercury. Onnes had been the first person to liquefy helium a few years earlier and was surprised to observe the resistivity of a mediocre conductor like mercury drop to zero at a temperature of 4.2 K. We define the temperature at which and below which a material becomes a superconductor to be its <term id="import-auto-id1169737712081">critical temperature</term>, denoted by <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math>. (See <link target-id="import-auto-id1169738093558"/>.) Progress in understanding how and why a material became a superconductor was relatively slow, with the first workable theory coming in 1957. Certain other elements were also found to become superconductors, but all had <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math> s less than 10 K, which are expensive to maintain. Although Onnes received a Nobel prize in 1913, it was primarily for his work with liquid helium.</para>
        <para id="import-auto-id1169737714564">In 1986, a breakthrough was announced—a ceramic compound was found to have an unprecedented <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math> of 35 K. It looked as if much higher critical temperatures could be possible, and by early 1988 another ceramic (this of thallium, calcium, barium, copper, and oxygen) had been found to have <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:mrow></m:msub><m:mo stretchy="false">=</m:mo><m:mtext>125 K</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mi/></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:mrow></m:math> (see <link target-id="import-auto-id1169738093358"/>.) The economic potential of perfect conductors saving electric energy is immense for <m:math><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mi>c</m:mi></m:mrow></m:msub></m:mrow><m:mrow/></m:mrow></m:math> s above 77 K, since that is the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Although liquid helium has a boiling point of 4 K and can be used to make materials superconducting, it costs about $5 per liter. Liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K, but only costs about $0.30 per liter. There was general euphoria at the discovery of these complex ceramic superconductors, but this soon subsided with the sobering difficulty of forming them into usable wires. The first commercial use of a high temperature superconductor is in an electronic filter for cellular phones. High-temperature superconductors are used in experimental apparatus, and they are actively being researched, particularly in thin film applications.</para><figure id="import-auto-id1169738093558"><media id="import-auto-id1169737933034" alt="The graph shows resistivity on the vertical axis and temperature on the horizontal axis.

        <caption>One characteristic of a superconductor is that it excludes magnetic flux and, thus, repels other magnets. The small magnet levitated above a high-temperature superconductor, which is cooled by liquid nitrogen, gives evidence that the material is superconducting. When the material warms and becomes conducting, magnetic flux can penetrate it, and the magnet will rest upon it.

Unfortunately, these observations are not routinely reproducible, with samples losing their superconducting nature once heated and recooled (cycled) a few times (see <link target-id="import-auto-id1169737805028"/>.)

        <figure id="import-auto-id1169737805028"><media id="import-auto-id1169736620940" alt="Figure a is a graph of resistivity versus temperature. The resistivity goes from zero to zero point six milli ohm centimeters and the temperature goes from one hundred to three hundred kelvin. There are three curves on the graph. The first curve starts near zero point one milli ohm centimeters, one hundred kelvin, and increases linearly to zero point six milli ohm centimeters, two hundred and eighty kelvin. The second curve is at zero resistivity from 100 kelvin to about two hundred and thirty five kelvin, then jumps straight up to zero point four milli ohm centimeters, after which it increases linearly with temperature with the same slope as the first curve. The third curve has one point at minus zero point zero five milli ohm centimeters at about one hundred and thirty kelvin, then becomes positive and increases essentially linearly with the same slope as the first curve. Figure b shows a scaffolding structure made up of rods. At each vertex in the scaffold there is a ball that is either white, red, purple, or blue. Each color represents a different kind of atom. The white balls are the largest, then the red, then the purple, and the blue balls are the smallest. The balls are arranged in a systematic pattern. From bottom to top the scaffold layers are formed from white and red balls, then red and blue balls, then purple balls, then again red and blue balls, then finally white and red balls again. In each individual layer the balls form various grid patterns. This scaffold structure forms a brick-like shape and an identical such brick is positioned above it with a gap between the two bricks. The two bricks are connected together by a single layer of blue balls. ">
